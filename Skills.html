        <p>Skills, "the ability to use one's knowledge effectively and readily in execution or performance" or "a learned power of doing
            something competently : a developed aptitude or ability".<sup>1</sup> I'm starting this off by giving the meaning of what 
            "Skills" are.<sup>2</sup> Now that I've done that, I will now share to you what my skills are.<sup>3</sup> Granted however, 
            the "skills" that I am going to be mentioning have either "aged with time" or "not fully there yet", so to speak.<sup>4</sup> 
            And with that, let's get to the good stuff.<sup>5</sup> Starting off strong with my singing skills, and while we're here, I 
            might as well add my skills in beatboxing.<sup>6</sup> Now, I will admit that I am a bit rusty when it comes to beatboxing, 
            and haven't really been doing it for quite a while now.<sup>7</sup> However, I am still confident enough to “drop a beat”, 
            if you know what I mean.<sup>8</sup> As for my singing, I can say with certainty that this is one of the skills I have up my 
            sleeve that I am proud of.<sup>9</sup> To tell you the truth, I sucked at singing when I was in my early teenage years.<sup>10</sup> 
            It was only until I hit 15 years old that my singing got better.<sup>11</sup> Through enough patience and a lot of practice, my 
            singing voice today is honestly great.<sup>12</sup> Next up in my list of skills is my “communication skills”, 
            or my “formal way of speaking”.<sup>13</sup> This skill of mine has “been through the ringer”, for lack of a better word.<sup>14</sup> 
            I had to keep on trying new ways of speaking, different “hits” of accents, and even the deepness of my voice.<sup>15</sup> 
            It was really only until I was 17 years old that I honestly got a perfect balance of what I wanted.<sup>16</sup> 
            My communication skills now are honestly the best it has ever been, and I intend to continue on improving it.<sup>17</sup> 
            Now for something a bit more technical, my programming skills.<sup>18</sup> Now granted, my programming skills are still not 
            “honed”, so to speak, that is why I will make sure I still improve on this matter.<sup>19</sup> But for now, the skills I have with 
            programming and my logical thinking are honestly fine.<sup>20</sup> Obviously it still isn’t there, but to be fair to me, I still 
            am learning.<sup>21</sup> Now to finish it off with a skill I am lowkey proud of, my driving skills.<sup>22</sup> My 
            driving skills, especially in my motorcycle, are honestly something I am really proud of.<sup>23</sup> There’s something
            about it that makes me have “bragging rights” even though I am fully aware that I am not the only one that can drive.<sup>24</sup> 
            And that is all for my skills, let’s move onto the next one.<sup>25</sup>

        <p>Now we get to talk about my hobbies.<sup>1</sup> Hobbies, “an activity that you do for pleasure when you are not working”.<sup>2</sup> 
            Let's start off with a favorite of mine, which is "moto-driving" or if the time and place allows it, "long-driving" with my 
            motorcycle.<sup>3</sup> There's just something so special about taking my motor out on a small, or long, trip.<sup>4</sup> Leaving 
            all of my worries and problems at my house, and just generally being freed from my responsibilities.<sup>5</sup> I get to think 
            about my life-goals, my dreams, and even everything I have achieved up to this day.<sup>6</sup> Next up in my list of hobbies is 
            gaming.<sup>7</sup> I absolutely adore gaming.<sup>8</sup> Gaming is one of the few things in life that will make any bad day 
            into a good day.<sup>9</sup> Which, in a way, is kind of hilarious because, at least my installed games, they “promote violence”, 
            but that’s neither here nor there.<sup>10</sup> Games are also just a good way of “leaving reality” and just giving you the 
            break you deserve.<sup>11</sup> Now onto the next hobby of mine that I very much adore, again, is photography.<sup>12</sup> 
            Photography is just a “vibe”, for lack of a better word.<sup>13</sup> It accomplishes two things at once.<sup>14</sup> 
            It makes me appreciate my surroundings, and it also eases my mind.<sup>15</sup> Those two things are honestly just great 
            criterias to be checked off a list when having hobbies.<sup>16</sup> Another pro of photography is that it sharpens my 
            “creative mind”.<sup>17</sup> It forces my mind to look at other perspectives, be it literal or figuratively, and makes me 
            act upon it.<sup>18</sup> If you can’t tell, my hobbies revolve around “giving me a vibe” or “gives me an escape” and 
            honestly, that’s all I want when I have free time.<sup>19</sup> Escape all my problems, even if it's for a little bit, all 
            my hobbies achieve this, and I really do appreciate that fact.<sup>20</sup>

        <p>Now for my interests.<sup>1</sup> Interests, “the state of wanting to know or learn about something or someone.”<sup>2</sup> 
            As someone who becomes curious and fascinated when a topic/subject I like presents itself, I have quite the list of 
            interests that I can share.<sup>3</sup> First on my list of interests are motors.<sup>4</sup> I absolutely love motorcycles 
            because they give you this sense of freedom that is honestly kind of hard to beat.<sup>5</sup> Second on my list would be 
            “the 1990’s up to 2006.”<sup>6</sup> More specifically, I’m interested in the technology that they have.<sup>7</sup> There’s 
            just something about seeing tech from way back and then looking at what we have now.<sup>8</sup> It absolutely astonishes me 
            the difference between the two.<sup>9</sup> Now onto a segue into the next topic, technology itself.<sup>10</sup> 
            I absolutely love knowing about technology that we have today.<sup>11</sup> Just sit down and really think about it, if it 
            weren’t for the advancements that humanity made on technology, all of us wouldn’t be able to do at least 80% of what we are 
            capable of doing right now.<sup>12</sup> That is why technology absolutely peaks my interest, that and also its hold and 
            effect on our everyday lives.<sup>13</sup> Anything from smart fridges to supercomputers to the thing we all have in our 
            pockets, our phones.<sup>14</sup> And speaking of, let’s now move onto “my forte” in technology, phones and anything related 
            to it.<sup>15</sup> Just like any other tech, if you really think about it, our phones are basically nothing 
            short of magic.<sup>16</sup> In the palm of our hands or inside the pockets of our pants is something that is capable of 
            giving us the answers to a query we have at just a snap of a finger.<sup>17</sup> If that doesn’t make you go in awe, 
            realize that our phones are basically a camera, an mp3 and mp4 player, a T.V, a games console, and a computer, all in one 
            small package.<sup>18</sup> That is why my interest always peaks whenever the mention of phones comes into a conversation.<sup>19</sup> 
            Last but certainly not the least, is my interest and curiosity about our observable universe.<sup>20</sup> There’s something 
            quite existential about having an interest like this, but it still absolutely peaks my interest.<sup>21</sup> Watching videos 
            about the universe and everything it encompasses just makes me really think about life, and how “small” we humans are, 
            compared to the grand scheme of things.<sup>22</sup> Truly wonderful if you ask me.<sup>23</sup>
