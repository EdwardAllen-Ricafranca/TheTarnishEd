        <p>Norway has always fascinated me with its incredible natural beauty and peaceful vibe. It’s like this perfect mix of rugged 
            landscapes and charming, quiet towns. The fjords are probably the first thing that comes to mind—those deep blue, 
            crystal-clear waters surrounded by steep, green mountains just look surreal. I’ve seen pictures of Geirangerfjord and 
            Nærøyfjord, and they genuinely look like something straight out of a fairytale. I’d also love to visit during winter to 
            catch the Northern Lights. Imagine standing out there, wrapped up in a warm coat, looking up at the sky as it bursts into 
            waves of green and purple. It’s one of those bucket list experiences I can’t wait to check off. Plus, Norway’s got these cozy 
            little towns like Bergen with its colorful wooden houses and Tromsø, which seems like the best place to catch the 
            Aurora Borealis. Another big draw for me is how Norway seems to embrace the great outdoors. I want to hike some of their 
            famous trails like Preikestolen or Trolltunga, which offer some of the most breathtaking views. And of course, I’d like to 
            explore Oslo for its modern architecture, art museums, and vibrant culture.</p>

        <p>Getting to Norway from the Philippines is pretty straightforward, but it’s quite a journey. There aren’t direct flights, 
            so I’d likely have to fly from Manila to a major hub in Europe, like Amsterdam or London, and then catch a connecting 
            flight to Oslo.</p>
